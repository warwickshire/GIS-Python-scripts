========
This repository contains a couple of Python scripts that may be of use to other GIS sys-admins.

* A script which reads in a WMS GetCapabilities file and creates a KML file that allows direct access to all layers contained within it.

* A script for reading in FME log files (ideally created during an automatic batch process) that parses them and creates a summary of the results. Also emails specified users if there are any ERROR level events.
